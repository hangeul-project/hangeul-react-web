# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## ‼️ Tools 
- IDE : `vscode` 사용 (권장)
    - [블로그포스트 : vscode 에서 react 사용하기](https://blog.ull.im/engineering/2018/11/30/using-react-in-vs-code.html)
    - [vscode react tutorial](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/nodejs/reactjs-tutorial)
- CI&CD : Github Actions & Firebase Hosting 

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### ‼️ `npm run lint`
lint check 를 진행합니다. 본 레포는 husky 라는 git hook 을 사용하여, `git commit` 이라는 커맨드를 사용하면 자동으로 스테이징된 파일들에 대해서 lint check 를 진행하므로, `npm run lint` 는 파일을 작성하는 도중에 확인하는 용도로 사용하시면 됩니다. 

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
